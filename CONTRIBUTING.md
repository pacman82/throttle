# Contributions

Wether they be in code, intersting feature suggestions, design critique or bug reports, all contributions are welocme. Please start an issue, before investing a lot of work. This helps avoid situations there I would feel the need to reject a large body of work, and a lot of your time has been wasted. Throttle is a pet project and a work of love, which implies that I maintain it in my spare time. Please understand that I may not always react immediatly. If you contribute code to fix a Bug, please also contribute the test to fix it. Happy contributing.

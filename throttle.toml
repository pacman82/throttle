# Sample throttle.cfg Explaining the options

# The time interval in which the litter collection backgroud thread checks for expired leases.
# Default is set to 5 minutes.
# litter_collection_interval = "5min"

[semaphores]
# Specify name and full count of semaphores. Uncomment the below line to create a semaphore named A
# with a full count of 42 and lock level 0. Setting the count to 1 would create a Mutex. If plan to
# acquire several locks at once to different semaphores. You should give the ones you want to
# acquire first a higher lock level. Throttle accepts a signed 32 bit integer as lock level.
# A = { max=42, level=0 }

# Lock level 0 is quite common. So there is a shortcut. This creates also a semaphore with full
# count 42 and default lock level 0.
# A = 42

# Alternative verbose style. This is not specific to throttle, it is just how TOML works.
# [semaphores.A]
# max = 42
# level = 0

# Uncomment below lines to log to standard error.
# [logging.stderr]
## Set this to either ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG or TRACE. Default is WARN.
# level = "WARN"
